## 🎯 What to Do Right Now

### Option A: Do Nothing (Recommended) ✅
Training is stable. Let it run. Check back in 5 hours.

### Option B: Monitor Every Hour
```bash
# Check progress
Get-Content train_stats/evaluation_metrics.txt -Tail 5
# or
ls -la train_stats/training_curves.png  # Exists = past epoch 1
```

### Option C: Review Docs While Waiting 📖
```bash
# Read these in any order:
# - TRAINING_GUIDE.md (understand the approach)
# - README.md (overview)
# - RESULTS.md (structure of final report)
```

---

## ✅ Phase 2: When Training Completes

**You'll see**:
```
Epoch 10/10 [Val]: 100% | loss=0.62 | IoU=0.60 | Dice=0.70 | Acc=0.82
Training completed successfully!
```

**Do this** (copy & paste):
```bash
# 1. Check artifacts exist
ls -la checkpoint_final.pt
ls -la train_stats/training_curves.png

# 2. Run evaluation
python run_post_training_eval.py

# 3. Package submission
python create_submission_package.py

# 4. Setup GitHub
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "DINOv2 baseline submission"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOU/hackathon-segmentation.git
git push -u origin main

# 5. Add collaborators (in GitHub web interface)
# Settings → Collaborators → Add: Maazsyedm, rebekah-bogdanoff, egold010
```

That's it! You're done.

## 📊 Key Files to Review

### Before Training Completes
- **TRAINING_GUIDE.md** - Understand what's happening
- **README.md** - Project overview
- **SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md** - What judges will check

### After Training Completes
- **train_stats/training_curves.png** - Verify loss decreased
- **train_stats/evaluation_metrics.txt** - Note final IoU
- **EVALUATION_REPORT.txt** - Generated by eval script
- **results/failure_analysis.json** - Per-class breakdown

### Before Submitting
- **RESULTS.md** - Has all metrics (should be auto-filled)
- **submission.zip** - Final package to submit
- **GitHub README** - Public facing documentation

## 📝 Key Metrics (Baseline Expectations)

| Metric | Expected | Pass? |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Validation IoU | 0.55-0.65 | ✓ |
| Dice Score | 0.65-0.75 | ✓ |
| Pixel Accuracy | 0.80-0.85 | ✓ |
| Inference Speed | <50 ms | ✓ |
| Classes Segmented | 11/11 | ✓ |
| Model Size | <15 MB | ✓ |

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Training Error
```bash
# Restart training
python dataset/train_segmentation.py
# It will resume from last checkpoint (if implemented)
```

### Evaluation Error
```bash
# Debug evaluation
python -u run_post_training_eval.py  # Verbose mode
# Check: Offroad_Segmentation_Training_Dataset/ exists
# Check: checkpoint_final.pt exists
```

### GitHub Error
```bash
# Reset git
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init"

# Or push to different repo
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOU/new-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎓 Model Architecture (Quick Overview)

```
Frozen DINOv2-ViT-S/14 backbone
          ↓ (384-dim embeddings)
    Lightweight head
     (10M parameters)
          ↓ (11 classes)
   Output segmentation mask
```

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ Fast to train (frozen backbone)
- ✅ Fast inference (<50ms)
- ✅ Good generalization (pre-trained)
- ✅ Reproducible (fixed seed)

## 🚀 Success Criteria

- [ ] Training completes (Epoch 10/10)
- [ ] Metrics logged (IoU > 0.55)
- [ ] Evaluation runs successfully
- [ ] Submission package created (submission.zip)
- [ ] GitHub repo created with code
- [ ] Collaborators added (3 judges)
- [ ] Form submitted with link
- [ ] 🎉 **DONE!**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Don't watch training constantly** - it's boring and doesn't help. Check once per hour.

2. **Metrics will auto-fill in RESULTS.md** - the evaluation script does this for you.

3. **GitHub is optional for training but required for submission** - make it easy for judges.

4. **Keep submission.zip < 100 MB** - it will be (checkpoint ~10MB, code ~20MB, docs ~2MB).

5. **Test locally before submitting** - the packaging script verifies everything.

---

## 🎯 TL;DR (The Absolute Minimum)

```bash
# Wait ~5 hours for training to finish, then:

python run_post_training_eval.py        # Generate metrics
python create_submission_package.py     # Package for submission
# Manually: git setup + GitHub push
# Manually: Add 3 judge collaborators
# Manually: Fill submission form
# Done!
```
